When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    I would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all work local when - for example - I collaborate with other people. When we work on some project together and it is much easier to access the code online. Or if I simply want to publish my project publicly. Other example can be when I work from different computers as well as a way to back up my code.
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I want to always pull changes manually because like this I have control over my code and I can decide if I want to pull changes to my local repository or not yet. For example if some code introduces the bug I might not want to pull that change until the problem is fixed.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

   

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

   

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?



When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
